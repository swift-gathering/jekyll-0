# A Swift Gathering
Learning some basics about HTML, CSS and Jekyll by making my own blog.

This blog uses the [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll theme. Thanks to [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/) for creating a beautiful, thought out, well documented theme.
